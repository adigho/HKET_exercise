Part 1:

stock_getter.py gets all HK stock with respect to their stock number and stock name from HKEJ and stores the information to stock_list.txt for later parts

part1.py is the main program for part 1 which read stock_list.txt and open ETNet and AAStocks by headless Chrome webdriver and scrape information from them.
As the limitation of CPU, only 10 processes are called once and generally 40 stock details (20 from ETNet and AAStocks) are scraped in one minute.
The program can be terminated by pressing Crtl-C and it may takes about one minute to close the webdriver
